# Research project on Text Simplification

Previous work was on Text Simplification with Transformer-based model (described [here](https://github.com/Leushina/simplification)). 

[Question Generation](Question Generation) contains experiments 
on mixing Text Simplification and Question Generation. 
It is heavily based on [huggingface library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).
